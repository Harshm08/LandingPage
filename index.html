        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>
          The stock market is a platform where investors buy and sell shares of
          publicly traded companies. It plays a crucial role in the global
          economy, enabling companies to raise capital and investors to
          potentially profit from share price fluctuations. Stock prices are
          influenced by various factors, including company performance, economic
          indicators, and investor sentiment. While investing in stocks can
          offer opportunities for growth and income, it also carries risks, as
          prices can be volatile. Diversification and research are essential for
          successful investing. Stock markets, such as the New York Stock
          Exchange (NYSE) and NASDAQ, are central to the financial system,
          impacting businesses and individuals worldwide.
